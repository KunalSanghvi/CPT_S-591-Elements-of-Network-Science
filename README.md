# CPT_S-591-Elements-of-Network-Science
This repository consists of the project report, presentation, and the code developed and analyzed during the course 'Elements of Network Science.' This study compares and analyzes four navigation algorithms: Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, PageRank, and Random-walk algorithms, to determine their applicability to different types of networks.
